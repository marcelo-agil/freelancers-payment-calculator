# Payment Calculator

A project to calculate monthly payments by hours and days.

The script will calculate, for example, how many "fridays" exists in that month and multiply by the number of hours and price.

## Getting started

Simply open the index file on a browser and hit "How to", to create the first config.
Then you go to "Calculator" tab to run the full report.

## Using bootstrap 5

I had some options: use full bootstrap solution;
Use webpack or similar solution to strip unnecessary js code from bootstrap;
Use full javascript solution: the most lightweight and fast solution due to project's size, this means the project don't have a bootstrap.js file;

So I only use bootstrap to speed up css development and I'v stripped all the unnecessary code. The bootstrap.min.css goes from 155kb down to 8kb!

The bootstrap.min.js went from 55kb to zero: it's a full javascript solution.
